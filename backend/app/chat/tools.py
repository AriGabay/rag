"""The tools the answering model may call, and the evidence they produce.

The model never runs SQL and never sees anything the user may not: every tool runs in its own short
transaction under the user's tenant context (RLS decides what is visible), validates its arguments, and returns
plain text the model reads. Every passage a tool returns is registered as a source with an id (``S1``...); every
stored measurement as ``M1``...; every computation as ``C1``.... Every tool also records how deep it reached
into each document — located (listed in a set or outlined), a passage retrieved, a section or table read (or its
measurements listed) — and which sections and tables it opened, so the server can state an answer's coverage
itself; a document whose datum the verified answer cites is ``verified`` (``coverage.build``). An
answer may cite only ids issued in the same turn, so a previous answer is never a source: an earlier turn's
passages are offered as ``P`` references the model must re-open (``read``), which reads them again under the
current permissions and only while the document's reading is the one they were read from.

Documents, sections, tables, continuations and unread regions get turn-local short handles (``D#``, ``§#``,
``T#``, ``K#``, ``R#``) the server maps to what they name; every handle but ``D#`` is bound to the version and
the reading it was issued for, and every use resolves the document again under the current permissions (KTD9).

Tools:

- ``search``: hybrid retrieval (lexical, trigram, semantic) over text, tables, table rows and picture text,
  optionally within named documents;
- ``read``: one locator — a source (``S#``/``P#``: the paragraphs around it, or its whole table), a page range of
  a document, a section (``§#``, its sub-sections included), a table (``T#``) or the continuation of an earlier
  read (``K#``). A result is a part of bounded size whose header states whether it is complete, clipped (and the
  ``K#`` that continues it), has unread regions (marked in place with their ``R#``) or uncertain reading; blocks
  the turn already returned are sent as a pointer to the source that returned them (``app.chat.reader``);
- ``find_documents``: every document that contains all the terms that define a set (a place, a document type),
  in its title or text — the scope of a question about a set of documents, paged, with the total;
- ``list_documents``: visible documents with their reading status (fully read, partial: what was not read), paged;
- ``outline``: a document's sections and tables as openable handles, with their sizes and unread regions;
- ``find_measurements``: stored measurements with their meaning (kind, unit, period, area basis, VAT, role,
  subject), grouped by what can be compared, with the coverage of the documents in scope, paged;
- ``compute``: mean / median / sum / min / max / count / difference / ratio over measurements, in exact
  decimal code, refusing to mix kinds, units, periods, VAT status, area bases or roles.
